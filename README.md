# Profitless Projects that Matter!

Creating applications is relatvely easy today. With the abundance of frameworks, platforms and services it's possible to construct functional applications that add value for at least one individual. In a way, this harkens back to the original users of computers who wrote applications to solve their own problems, or more colloquially scratch their own itch. 

What is more difficult is creating an application that can be a viable business. Creating something of sufficient and sustained value to fund an operation is incredibly difficult and very risky. As a result, this usually leads to applications that serve a large need, but often a need that is trivial or a convenience. However, meeting that large need it can be profitable. On the flip side, this also means that applications that can be easily written are often neglected and overlooked. This is a shame, because cost effective compute can increasingly solve problems that will markedly improve a smaller populations lives. This is very much akin to the problem of "orphan drugs' or "rare diseases" in the pharmaceutical space. In the drug space, the barriers of approval are high (and in many ways justifiably so) which rules out research on these rare diseases because it cannot be profitable.
