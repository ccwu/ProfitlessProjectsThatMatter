# Profitless Projects that Matter!

Creating applications is relatvely easy today. With the abundance of frameworks, platforms and services it's possible to construct functional applications that add value for at least one individual. In a way, this harkens back to the original users of computers who wrote applications to solve their own problems, or more colloquially scratch their own itch. 

What is more difficult is creating an application that can be a viable business. Creating something of sufficient and sustained value to fund an operation is incredibly difficult and very risky. As a result, this usually leads to applications that serve a large need, but often a need that is trivial or a convenience. However, meeting that large need it can be profitable. On the flip side, this also means that applications that can be easily written are often neglected and overlooked. This is a shame, because cost effective compute can increasingly solve problems that will markedly improve a smaller populations lives. This is very much akin to the problem of "orphan drugs' or "rare diseases" in the pharmaceutical space. In the drug space, the barriers of approval are high (and in many ways justifiably so) which rules out research on these rare diseases because it cannot be profitable. 

What is captured in this repository are software projects that are similar to these rare disease drug challenges, too small a market to build a business. But unlike drug discovery, the cost of software is much less. So this is an invitation to developers who are looking for projects that can make a difference to practice on or just plain old volunteer. Ideally they really use technology, and are not just simple CRUD applications. But if there is specific data that can make a difference if collected well. They should be able to be written in a way that the recipient can conceivably run easily via a PaaS or good old fashion shared hosting. Or better yet, a stand alone mobile or desktop application that can be downloaded and installed with no future maintenance needed.
